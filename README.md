# InstagramPosting
This is a small script to allow someone to post to instagram from their pc.

It exists in PHP and we are currently in the process of converting it to python. After that we will create an API endpoint so
it can be accessed.

##How it works
Go to interactive.php and enter in your instagram information. (This is obviously not secure yet), then start a local php server or any kind of server you want and load the interactive.php file.

This will post the image you have entered in the interactive.php file to the instagram account you specified. 

email me at levi.paradis@gmail.com if you have questions.
